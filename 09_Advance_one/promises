# What is Promise Function in javascript?

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is used for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or any other operation that might take some time to complete.


A Promise is in one of three states:

1.Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2.Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
3.Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
